# Property Investment Reports for Homebuyers and Conveyancer
This project, part of the "Creative Coding for Urban Problems" module in my masterâ€™s program and developed in collaboration with Martello, focused on analyzing Leeds City Council's planning application data to provide insights for homebuyers and conveyancers. By utilizing the ChatGPT API, I streamlined the process of interpreting planning applications through tailored prompts, ensuring relevant responses for property purchases. The final report was generated in HTML format, offering a clear and accessible presentation for non-professionals and is fully reproducible for future use in different locations.
